Heart Failure	Heart failure is not a single pathological diagnosis, but a clinical syndrome consisting of cardinal symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle . swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated . jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema). It is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.	https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Acute-and-Chronic-Heart-Failure	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(84114007) | ((?i)(heart|cardiac|ventricular) failure) | ((?i)cardiac insufficiency) | ( HF )
Myocardial infarction	The clinical definition of myocardial denotes the presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of myocardial injury (new ischaemic ECG changes loss of viable myocardium on imaging, coronary thrombosis on angiography or aithopsy).	https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000617	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(22298006) | ((?i)myocardial infarction) | ((?i)acute ischa?emic heart disease) | ((?i)acute .*coronary .*(disease|dysfunction)) | ((?i)dressler)
Coronary artery bypass grafting	Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a procedure that involves sternotomy to bypass diseased segment(s) of the coronary tree using blood vessels derived other parts of the body and connected to the aorta.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-cabg/	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4, ICD9_procedure	(K4[0-9][0-9]?) | (K50[0-9]?|K75[0-9]?) | ((?i)coronary (artery )?bypass) | ((?i)aortocoronary bypass) | (CABG) | ((?i)(graft|replacement|connection|anastomosis|implantation|bypass|repair|operations?|open angioplasty) .*coronary arter(y|ies)) | (232717009)
Percutaneous coronary intervention	Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is defined as the placement of an angioplasty guidewire, balloon, or other device (e.g. stent, atherectomy, brachytherapy, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or a graft for the purpose of mechanical coronary revascularisation. The assessment of coronary lesion severity by fluoroscopy, intracoronary imaging (e.g. intravascular ultrasonography) or physiology (e.g. fractional flow reserve) is not considered a PCI procedure.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-angioplasty/	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4, ICD9_procedure	(K49[0-9]+?|K50[0-9]+|K75[0-9]+) | ((?i)percutaneous coronary intervention) | ((?i)(percutaneous|transluminal) .*(angioplasty|stent|thrombolysis|thrombectomy|therapeutic|atherectomy|operations|lithotripsy).*coronar(y|ies)) | ((?i)(percutaneous|transluminal) .*coronar(y|ies) .*(angioplasty|stent|thrombolysis|thrombectomy|therapeutic|atherectomy|operations|lithotripsy)) | (415070008)
Thrombolysis (coronary)	The delivery of thrombolytic therapy, either intravenously or intracoronary, for the treatment of coronary thrombosis.	https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.CIR.97.16.1632	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4, ICD9_procedure	(K502) | (coronary thrombolysis) | ((?i)thrombolytic) | (thrombolysis) | (32912007)
Congenital heart disease	Congenital heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiac defects that affect the normal  heart function. They are fault or problems that are present from birth.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/congenital-heart-disease/	ICD9, ICD10, SNOMED	(13213009) | (Q2[0-6][0-9]?) | ((?i)congenital.*(heart|cardiac)) | ((?i)(heart|cardiac).*congenital) | ((?i)congenital .*(pulmonary|tricuspid|aortic|mitral) .*valves?) | ((?i)(congenital|transposition) .*great (arter[y|ies]|veins?)) | ((?i)fontan|fallot) | ((?i)(double outlet|single) .*ventricle) | ((?i)(atrial|ventric[ulare]+|aortopulmonary) septal defect) | ((?i)cor triatriatum|truncus arteriosus)
Congenital heart disease procedure	Congenital heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiac defects that affect the normal  heart function. They are fault or problems that are present from birth.
