DCM_IsA	Dilated cardiomyopathy	The presence of LV dilatation and global or regional systolic dysfunction unexplained solely by abnormal loading conditions (e.g. hypertension, valve disease, congenital heart disease, or coronary artery disease. (ESC, 2023)	https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(399020009) | ((?i)cardiomyopath(y|ies))
LVSD_IsA	Left ventricular systolic dysfunction	Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is defined here as any code indicating impaired LV ejection fraction, or heart failure with reduced or mid-range ejection fraction. HF reduced ejection fraction is defined as HF with  LVEF<40% and HF mid-range ejection fraction with LVEF 40-49%.	https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Acute-and-Chronic-Heart-Failure	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(systolic .*(dys-?function|failure|insufficiency)) | (134401001)
Myocardial_infarction	Myocardial infarction	The clinical definition of myocardial denotes the presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of myocardial injury (new ischaemic ECG changes loss of viable myocardium on imaging, coronary thrombosis on angiography or aithopsy).	https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000617	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(22298006) | ((?i)myocardial infarction) | ((?i)acute ischa?emic heart disease) | ((?i)acute .*coronary .*(disease|dysfunction)) | ((?i)dressler)
Coronary_artery_bypass_grafting	Coronary artery bypass grafting	Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a procedure that involves sternotomy to bypass diseased segment(s) of the coronary tree using blood vessels derived other parts of the body and connected to the aorta.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-cabg/	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4	(K4[0-9][0-9]?) | (K50[0-9]?|K75[0-9]?) | ((?i)coronary artery bypass) | (CABG) | ((?i)(graft|replacement|connection|anastomosis|implantation|bypass|repair|operations?|open angioplasty) .*coronary arter(y|ies)) | (232717009)
Percutaneous_coronary_intervent	Percutaneous coronary intervention	Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is defined as the placement of an angioplasty guidewire, balloon, or other device (e.g. stent, atherectomy, brachytherapy, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or a graft for the purpose of mechanical coronary revascularisation. The assessment of coronary lesion severity by fluoroscopy, intracoronary imaging (e.g. intravascular ultrasonography) or physiology (e.g. fractional flow reserve) is not considered a PCI procedure.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-angioplasty/	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4	(K49[0-9]+?|K50[0-9]+|K75[0-9]+) | ((?i)percutaneous coronary intervention) | ((?i)(percutaneous|transluminal) .*(angioplasty|thrombolysis|therapeutic|atherectomy|operations) .*coronar(y|ies)) | ((?i)(percutaneous|transluminal) .*coronar(y|ies) .*(angioplasty|thrombolysis|therapeutic|atherectomy|operations)) | (415070008)
Thrombolysis_coronary	Thrombolysis (coronary)	The delivery of thrombolytic therapy, either intravenously or intracoronary, for the treatment of coronary thrombosis.	https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.CIR.97.16.1632	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4	(K502) | (coronary thrombolysis) | ((?i)thrombolytic) | (thrombolysis) | (32912007)
Congenital_heart_disease	Congenital heart disease	Congenital heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiac defects that affect the normal  heart function. They are fault or problems that are present from birth.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/congenital-heart-disease/	ICD9, ICD10, SNOMED	(13213009) | (Q2[0-6][0-9]?) | ((?i)congenital.*(heart|cardiac)) | ((?i)(heart|cardiac).*congenital) | ((?i)congenital .*(pulmonary|tricuspid|aortic|mitral) .*valves?) | ((?i)(congenital|transposition) .*great (arter[y|ies]|veins?)) | ((?i)fontan|fallot) | ((?i)(double outlet|single) .*ventricle) | ((?i)(atrial|ventric[ulare]+|aortopulmonary) septal defect) | ((?i)cor triatriatum|truncus arteriosus)
Congenital_heart_procedure	Congenital heart disease procedure	Congenital heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiac defects that affect the normal  heart function. They are fault or problems that are present from birth. This concept defines procedures for congenital heart disease.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/congenital-heart-disease/	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4	(K[0-2][4-9][0-9]?) | (K(29[67]|305|336|34[56]|35[467]|36[12]|37[1-6]|38[56]|482|577|76[189])) | (L1[0-3][0-9]?) | ((?i)congenital.*(heart|cardiac)) | ((?i)(heart|cardiac).*congenital) | ((?i)congenital .*(pulmonary|tricuspid|aortic|mitral) .*valves?) | ((?i)(congenital|transposition) .*great (arter[y|ies]|veins?)) | ((?i)fontan|norwood|fallot|blalock|mustard|senning|nikaidoh|jatene|rastelli) | ((?i)(double outlet|single) .*ventricle) | ((?i)(atrial|ventric[ulare]+|aortopulmonary) septal defect) | ((?i)cor triatriatum|truncus arteriosus) | (9359[3-7]) | (93594)
