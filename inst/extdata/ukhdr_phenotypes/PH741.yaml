definition: "Aims: \n\nTo determine association between HbA1C variability and hypoglycemia
  requiring hospitalization (HH) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes
  (T2D).\n\n\nMethods: \n\nUsing nested case-control design in electronic health record
  data in England, one case with first or recurrent HH was matched to one control
  who had not experienced HH in incident T1D and T2D adults. HbA1C variability was
  determined by standard deviation of ≥3 HbA1C results. Conditional logistic models
  were applied to determine association of HbA1C variability with first and recurrent
  HH.\n\n\nResults: \n\nIn T1D, every 1.0% increase in HbA1C variability was associated
  with 90% higher first HH risk (95% CI, 1.25–2.89) and 392% higher recurrent HH risk
  (95% CI, 1.17–20.61). In T2D, a 1.0% increase in HbA1C variability was associated
  with 556% higher first HH risk (95% CI, 3.88–11.08) and 573% higher recurrent HH
  risk (95% CI,1.59–28.51). In T2D for first HH, the association was the strongest
  in non-insulin non-sulfonylurea users (P b 0.0001); for recurrent HH, the association
  was stronger in insulin users than sulfonylurea users (P = 0.07). The HbA1C variability-HH
  association was stronger in more recent years in T2D (P ≤ 0.004).\n\n\nConclusions:
  \n\nHbA1C variability is a strong predictor for HH in T1D and T2D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
