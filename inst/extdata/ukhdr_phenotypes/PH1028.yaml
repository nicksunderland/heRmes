  # Combining evidence across sources to define and date phenotypes
  We took the first occurring diagnosis code in primary, secondary care or the death registry to define the date, and clinical setting, of diagnosis. A prevalent case was defined as existing at or before the date of baseline; and incident case was defined as the new occurrence of a heart failure diagnosis code among people who, at baseline, did not have any previous diagnosis codes.

  For identifying prevalent cases in primary care, we used a broader list of Read terms in addition to the case definition. While these terms alone did not provide sufficient certainty to identify incident cases, using them to exclude prevalent cases ensured that we removed any patient that had a historic or suspected HF diagnosis from the analysis.
