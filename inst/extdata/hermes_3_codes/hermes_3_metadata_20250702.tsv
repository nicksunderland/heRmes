Heart Failure	Heart failure is not a single pathological diagnosis, but a clinical syndrome consisting of cardinal symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle . swelling, and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated . jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles, and peripheral oedema). It is due to a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart that results in elevated intracardiac pressures and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise.	https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Acute-and-Chronic-Heart-Failure	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(84114007) | ((?i)(heart|cardiac|ventricular) failure) | ((?i)cardiac insufficiency) | ( HF )
Dilated cardiomyopathy	The presence of LV dilatation and global or regional systolic dysfunction unexplained solely by abnormal loading conditions (e.g. hypertension, valve disease, congenital heart disease, or coronary artery disease. (ESC, 2023)	https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad194	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(399020009) | ((?i)cardiomyopath(y|ies))
Dilated cardiomyopathy (associated with)	The presence of LV dilatation and global or regional systolic dysfunction unexplained solely by abnormal loading conditions (e.g. hypertension, valve disease, congenital heart disease, or coronary artery disease.

Left ventricular systolic dysfunction	Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is defined here as any code indicating impaired LV ejection fraction, or heart failure with reduced or mid-range ejection fraction. HF reduced ejection fraction is defined as HF with  LVEF<40% and HF mid-range ejection fraction with LVEF 40-49%.	https://www.escardio.org/Guidelines/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines/Acute-and-Chronic-Heart-Failure	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(systolic .*(dys-?function|failure|insufficiency)) | (134401001)
Myocardial infarction	The clinical definition of myocardial denotes the presence of acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of myocardial injury (new ischaemic ECG changes loss of viable myocardium on imaging, coronary thrombosis on angiography or aithopsy).	https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000617	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(22298006) | ((?i)myocardial infarction) | ((?i)acute ischa?emic heart disease) | ((?i)acute .*coronary .*(disease|dysfunction)) | ((?i)dressler)

Percutaneous coronary intervention	Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is defined as the placement of an angioplasty guidewire, balloon, or other device (e.g. stent, atherectomy, brachytherapy, or thrombectomy catheter) into a native coronary artery or a graft for the purpose of mechanical coronary revascularisation. The assessment of coronary lesion severity by fluoroscopy, intracoronary imaging (e.g. intravascular ultrasonography) or physiology (e.g. fractional flow reserve) is not considered a PCI procedure.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronary-angioplasty/	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4, ICD9_procedure	(K49[0-9]+?|K50[0-9]+|K75[0-9]+) | ((?i)percutaneous coronary intervention) | ((?i)(percutaneous|transluminal) .*(angioplasty|stent|thrombolysis|thrombectomy|therapeutic|atherectomy|operations|lithotripsy).*coronar(y|ies)) | ((?i)(percutaneous|transluminal) .*coronar(y|ies) .*(angioplasty|stent|thrombolysis|thrombectomy|therapeutic|atherectomy|operations|lithotripsy)) | (415070008)
Thrombolysis (coronary)	The delivery of thrombolytic therapy, either intravenously or intracoronary, for the treatment of coronary thrombosis.	https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.CIR.97.16.1632	SNOMED_procedure, OPCS4, CPT4, ICD9_procedure	(K502) | (coronary thrombolysis) | ((?i)thrombolytic) | (thrombolysis) | (32912007)
Ischaemic cardiomyopathy	Ischemic cardiomyopathy was defined as left ventricular dysfunction caused by coronary artery disease (CAD). Specifically, there must be the implication of cardiomyopathy or LV dysfunction, not simply coronary artery disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK209964/	SNOMED, ICD10, ICD9	(?i)ischa?emic heart disease|(?i)ischa?emic cardiomyopath(y|ies)|(?i)cardiomyopath(y|ies) ischa?emic
Congenital heart disease	Congenital heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiac defects that affect the normal  heart function. They are fault or problems that are present from birth.	https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/congenital-heart-disease/	ICD9, ICD10, SNOMED	(13213009) | (Q2[0-6][0-9]?) | ((?i)(congenital|anomal(ous|ies)|hypoplasia|supernumerary|atresia|aplasia|absen(ce|t)|transposition).*(heart|cardiac|myocard|epicard|pulmon(ic|ary)|tricuspid|mitral|aortic|vena cava|great (arter[y|ies]|veins?|vessels?)|coronary|aorta|atri(a|um)|ventric(ular|le))) | ((?i)congenital .*(pulmonary|tricuspid|aortic|mitral) .*valves?) | ((?i)parachute malformation .*mitral valve) | ((?i)subaortic stenosis) | ((?i)bicuspid .*aortic) | ((?i)fontan|fallot) | ((?i)(double (outlet|inlet)|single) .*ventricle) | ((?i)abnormal relationship .*(pulmonary|aortic|ventricle) .*(pulmonary|aortic|ventricle)) | ((?i)(abnormal|discordant|ambiguous|absent) atrioventricular connection) | ((?i)(atrial|ventric[ulare]+|aortopulmonary) sept(um|al) defect) | ((?i)cor triatriatum|truncus arteriosus) | ((?i)(double|right|left|interrupted) .*aortic arch) | ((?i)ebstein|holt[- ]?oram|eisenmenger|lutembacher|prune belly syndrome) | ((?i)(dextro|levo|meso|hemi|a)(cardia|rotation|transposition)) | ((?i)levoatrial cardinal vein) | ((?i)juxtaposed atrial appendage) | ((?i)coarctation) | ((?i)(abdominal|criss[- ]?cross|mirror[- ]?imaged) heart) | ((?i)endocardial cushion defect) | ((?i)ostium (primum|secundum)|foramen ovale) | ((?i)stenosis .*infundibulum) | ((?i)infundibul.* stenosis) | ((?i)cor triloculare) | ((?i)persistent aortic arch convolutions) | ((?i)single coronary artery) | ((?i)familial mitral valve prolapse)
