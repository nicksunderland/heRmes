definition: "Methods: \n\nData were drawn from the UK General Practice Research Database.
  Analyses evaluated the occurrence of 271 READ medical diagnostic codes, including
  categories for ‘Angina’, ‘Myocardial Infarction’, ‘Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting’
  (CABG), ‘percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty’ (PCTA) and ‘Other Coronary
  Heart Disease’. Time-to-event analyses were implemented to evaluate occurrences
  of different groups of codes after the index date.\n\n\nResults: \n\nAmong 300,020
  participants aged greater than 30 years there were 75,197 unique occurrences of
  coronary heart disease codes in 24,244 participants, with 12,495 codes for incident
  events and 62,702 for prevalent events. Among incident event codes, 3,607 (28.87%)
  were for angina, 3,262 (26.11%) were for MI, 514 (4.11%) for PCTA, 161 (1.29%) for
  CABG and 4,951 (39.62%) were for ‘Other CHD’. Among prevalent codes, 20,254 (32.30%)
  were for angina, 3,644 (5.81%) for MI, 34,542 (55.09%) for ‘Other CHD’ and 4,262
  (6.80%) for CABG or PCTA. Among 3,685 participants initially diagnosed exclusively
  with ‘Other CHD’ codes, 17.1% were recorded with angina within 5 years, 5.6% with
  myocardial infarction, 6.3% with CABG and 8.6% with PCTA. From 2000 to 2010, the
  overall incidence of CHD declined, as did the incidence of angina, but the incidence
  of MI did not change. The frequency of CABG declined, while PCTA increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
