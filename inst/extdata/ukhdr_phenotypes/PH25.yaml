  The data (demographics, emergency department letters, discharge summaries, clinical notes,
  lab results, vital signs) were retrieved and analyzed in near real-time from the structured and
  unstructured components of the electronic health record (EHR) using a variety of natural
  language processing (NLP) informatics tools belonging to the CogStack ecosystem, namely
  MedCAT and MedCATTrainer. The CogStack NLP pipeline captures negation, synonyms,
  and acronyms for medical SNOMED-CT concepts as well as surrounding linguistic context using
  deep learning and long short-term memory networks. MedCAT produces unsupervised
  annotations for all SNOMED-CT concepts under parent terms Clinical Finding, Disorder,
  Organism, and Event with disambiguation, pre-trained on MIMIC-III. The annotated
  SNOMED-CT terms are summarised below
