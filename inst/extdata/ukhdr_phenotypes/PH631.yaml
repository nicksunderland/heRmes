definition: "Objectives: \n\nLittle is known about the prevalence of comorbidity rates
  in people with severe mental illness (SMI) in UK primary care. We calculated the
  prevalence of SMI by UK country, English region and deprivation quintile, antipsychotic
  and antidepressant medication prescription rates for people with SMI, and prevalence
  rates of common comorbidities in people with SMI compared with people without SMI.\n\n\nDesign:
  \n\nRetrospective cohort study from 2000 to 2012.\n\n\nSetting: \n\n627 general
  practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a UK primary
  care database.\n\n\nParticipants: \n\nEach identified case (346 551) was matched
  for age, sex and general practice with 5 randomly selected control cases (1 732
  755) with no diagnosis of SMI in each yearly time point.\n\n\nOutcome measures:
  \n\nPrevalence rates were calculated for 16 conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
