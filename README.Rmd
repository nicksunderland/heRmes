The goal of **heRmes** is to standardise the heart failure phenotyping of collections of electronic health records. 

## Installation

You can install the latest version of **heRmes** like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicksunderland/heRmes")
```

## Phenotypes
The code lists underpinning the various phenotypes are stored in text files within the package structure at: `inst/extdata/ukhdr_phenotypes`. The format of the file matches that used by the [UKHDR Phenotype Library](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org), but the important columns are: `code`,	`description`, `coding_system.name`, `phenotype_id` and `phenotype_name`. Below is an example of how to view the available phenotypes and obtain the codes.  

### Avaiable phenotypes
For example, view the first 5 phenotypes. 
```{r ids}
get_phenotypes()[1:5]
```

### Codes
View the codes for `PH1645` corresponding to the HERMES Heart Failure phenotype.
```{r codes}
# top 5 codes
get_codes(pheno_id = "PH1645")[1:5, c("phenotype_id", "phenotype_name", "coding_system.name", "code")]
```

### Phenotyping a dataset
Create sample data. This can be in long (only one column containing diagnosis codes) or wide format (multiple columns containing diagnosis codes). *n.b. prioritising coding based on diagnosis code position (e.g. primary vs. secondary vs. tertiary positions) is not currently supported.*
```{r create_data}
set.seed(2020)
n   <- 10
dat <- data.frame(ids   = paste0("ID_", c(1:(n/2), 1:(n/2))), 
                  codes = sample(c("I420", "foo", "bar", "baz"), n, replace = TRUE), 
                  codes1 = sample(c("I420", "foo", "bar", "baz"), n, replace = TRUE))
dat
```

Phenotype the individuals with phenotype `PH1643` (heart failure syndrome) or `PH1646` (cardiomyopathy), excluding phenotypes `PH1637` (congenital heart disease) and `PH1636` (myocardial infarction). There can be multiple included or excluded phenotypes given in a list. 
```{r phenotype}
result <- phenotype(x        = dat, 
                    id_col   = "ids",
                    code_col = c("codes", "codes1"), 
                    include  = list("PH1643", "PH1646"), 
                    exclude  = list("PH1637", "PH1636", "PH1640"))
result[]
```

#### Code formatting issues
Many of the coding systems have slight formating differences - for example an ICD-10 code may appear as `I509` or `I50.9` in a dataset. The `phenotype()` provides a way to clean these codes through use of the `gsub` argument. This takes a 3 element list: [[1]] is a string representing the regular expression pattern, [[2]] is the replacement string, and [[3]] is a character or character vector which can be one or more of: `x` (apply to codes in `x`), `pheno` (apply to all codes in phenotypes), `both` (apply to everything), or a valid phenotype ID found in `include` or `exclude` (apply to specific phenotype datasets). Other arguments can be passed to `gsub` through `...`.  

It is important to inspect your dataset (`x`) and phenotype coding (use `get_codes()`) prior to running the phenotyping to avoid join issues related to formatting differences.

Output formatting can be changed by altering the inputs. If the phenotype IDs are named, these names are used as column names in the result. The overall result is given in the column `overall`, although this can be renamed by giving the `name` parameter.   

```{r phenotype_complex}
# change format
dat[10, "codes1"] <- "I42.0"
dat[]

# without dealing with the error ID_5 is incorrectly classified as no HF. 
wrong <- phenotype(x        = dat, 
                   id_col   = "ids",
                   code_col = c("codes", "codes1"),
                   include  = list(HFsyn  = "PH1643", CM = "PH1646"), 
                   exclude  = list(congHD = "PH1637", MI = "PH1636", HCM = "PH1640"), 
                   name     = "Heart Failure")
wrong[]

# deal with formatting issue using gsub
pheno <- phenotype(x        = dat, 
                   id_col   = "ids",
                   code_col = c("codes", "codes1"),
                   include  = list(HFsyn  = "PH1643", CM = "PH1646"), 
                   exclude  = list(congHD = "PH1637", MI = "PH1636", HCM = "PH1640"), 
                   gsub     = list("\\.", "", c("x")),
                   name     = "Heart Failure")
pheno[]
```

### Update library from UKHDR
This package's phenotype library can be updated from the [UKHDR Phenotype Library API](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/api/v1/) using the below function. This queries the library for phenotypes matching enteries in the `search_terms` argument. 
```{r update, eval = TRUE}
update_library(search_terms = c("heart failure", "cardiomyopathy", "myocardial infarction"))
```

### Update library from UKHDR (unpublished)
This package's phenotype library can be updated with unpublished/development phenotypes from the [UKHDR Phenotype Library API](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/api/v1/) using the below function. However, since unpublished phenotypes are not searchable by name, we need to pass the exact ID and also login details for the website (stored in a local `.Renviron` file in this example.) 
```{r update_private, eval=FALSE}
# development phenotypes, ids named for readability only
hermes_phenos <- c(`Congenital heart disease`    = "PH1637", 
                   `Myocardial infarction`       = "PH1636", 
                   `Secondary cardiomyopathies`  = "PH1642", 
                   `Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy` = "PH1640", 
                   `Dilated cardiomyopathy`      = "PH1638", 
                   `Cardiomyopathy`              = "PH1646", 
                   `Heart failure`               = "PH1645", 
                   `Non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy`= "PH1639", 
                   `Heart failure syndrome`      = "PH1643")

# update
update_library(search_terms = c(), 
               ids          = hermes_phenos, 
               UKHDR_UN     = Sys.getenv("UKHDR_UN"), 
               UKHDR_PW     = Sys.getenv("UKHDR_PW"))
```

### Plotting phenotype 
To see the intersection of the codes in two or more phenotype files use the `plot_code_overlap()` function. 
```{r plot, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.width=12, fig.height=18}
plot_code_overlap(pheno_ids = c("PH1645", "PH1028", "PH1055", "PH1074", "PH182", "PH25", "PH530", "PH531", "PH631", "PH687", "PH968", "PH993"), 
                  types = c("ICD10 codes", "ICD9 codes", "OPCS4 codes", "Read codes v2"))
```

### Plot the ICD-10 HERMES phenotypes
```{r plot_hermes, eval=FALSE}
plot_code_overlap(pheno_ids = hermes_phenos, types = c("ICD10 codes"))
```
