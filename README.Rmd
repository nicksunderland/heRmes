The goal of **heRmes** is to standardise the heart failure phenotyping of collections of electronic health records. 

## Installation

You can install the latest version of **heRmes** like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicksunderland/heRmes")
```

## Phenotypes
The code lists underpinning the various phenotypes are stored in text files within the package structure at: `inst/extdata/ukhdr_phenotypes`. The format of the file matches that used by the [UKHDR Phenotype Library](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org), but the important columns are: `code`,	`description`, `coding_system.name`, `phenotype_id` and `phenotype_name`. Below is an example of how to view the available phenotypes and obtain the codes.  

### Avaiable phenotypes
For example, view the first 6 phenotypes. 
```{r ids}
get_phenotypes()[1:5]
```

### Codes
View the codes for `PH1645` corresponding to the HERMES Heart Failure phenotype.
```{r codes}
# top 5 codes
get_codes(pheno_id = "PH1645")[1:5, c("phenotype_id", "phenotype_name", "coding_system.name", "code")]
```

### Phenotyping a dataset
Create sample data in long format (multiple ID entries per asscoaited EHR code).
```{r create_data}
set.seed(2020)
n   <- 10
dat <- data.frame(ids   = paste0("ID_", c(1:(n/2), 1:(n/2))), 
                  codes = sample(c("I420", "foo", "bar", "baz"), n, replace = TRUE))
dat
```

Phenotype the individuals with phenotype `PH1645` (heart failure), excluding phenotype `PH1637` (congenital heart disease). There can be multiple included or excluded phenotypes given in a list. 
```{r phenotype}
result <- phenotype(dat$ids, dat$codes, 
                    name    = "Heart Failure", 
                    include = list(HF = "PH1645"), 
                    exclude = list(congHD = "PH1637"))
result[]
```

### Update library from UKHDR
The package phenotype library can be updated from the [UKHDR Phenotype Library API](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/api/v1/) using the below function. This queries the library for phenotypes matching enteries in the `search_terms` argument. 
```{r update, eval = TRUE}
update_library(search_terms = c("heart failure", "cardiomyopathy", "myocardial infarction"))
```

### Plotting phenotype 
To see the intersection of the codes in two or more phenotype files use the `plot_code_overlap()` function. 
```{r plot, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', fig.width=12, fig.height=18}
plot_code_overlap(pheno_ids = c("PH1645", "PH1028", "PH1055", "PH1074", "PH182", "PH25", "PH530", "PH531", "PH631", "PH687", "PH968", "PH993"), 
                  types = c("ICD10 codes", "ICD9 codes", "OPCS4 codes", "Read codes v2"))
```

### Update library from UKHDR (unpublished)
The package phenotype library can be updated with unpublished/development phenotypes from the [UKHDR Phenotype Library API](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/api/v1/) using the below function. However, since unpublished phenotypes are not searchable by name, we need to pass the exact ID and also login details for the website (stored in a local `.Renviron` file in this example.) 
```{r update_private, eval = TRUE}
# development phenotypes, ids named for readability only
hermes_phenos <- c(`Congenital heart disease`    = "PH1637", 
                   `Myocardial infarction`       = "PH1636", 
                   `Secondary cardiomyopathies`  = "PH1642", 
                   `Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy` = "PH1640", 
                   `Dilated cardiomyopathy`      = "PH1638", 
                   `Cardiomyopathy`              = "PH1646", 
                   `Heart failure`               = "PH1645", 
                   `Non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy`= "PH1639", 
                   `Heart failure syndrome`      = "PH1643")

# update
update_library(search_terms = c(), 
               ids          = hermes_phenos, 
               UKHDR_UN     = Sys.getenv("UKHDR_UN"), 
               UKHDR_PW     = Sys.getenv("UKHDR_PW"))
```

### Plot the ICD-10 HERMES phenotypes
```{r plot_hermes}
plot_code_overlap(pheno_ids = hermes_phenos, types = c("ICD10 codes"))
```
