definition: "Background:\n\nSelf-harm is a major risk factor for suicide, with older
  adults (older than 65 years) having reportedly greater suicidal intent than any
  other age group. With the aging population rising and paucity of research focus
  in this age group, the extent of the problem of self-harm needs to be established.
  In a primary care cohort of older adults we aimed to investigate the incidence of
  self-harm, subsequent clinical management, prevalence of mental and physical diagnoses,
  and unnatural-cause mortality risk, including suicide.\n\n\nMethods:\n\nThe UK Clinical
  Practice Research Datalink contains anonymised patient records from general practice
  that routinely capture clinical information pertaining to both primary and secondary
  care services. We identified 4124 adults aged 65 years and older with a self-harm
  episode ascertained from Read codes recorded during 2001–14. We calculated standardised
  incidence and in 2854 adults with at least 12 months follow-up examined the frequency
  of psychiatric referrals and prescription of psychotropic medication after self-harm.
  We estimated prevalence of mental and physical illness diagnoses before and after
  self-harm and, using Cox regression in a matched cohort, we examined cause-specific
  mortality risks.\n\n\nFindings:\n\nOverall incidence of self-harm in older adults
  aged 65 years and older was 4·1 per 10 000 person-years with stable gender-specific
  rates observed over the 13-year period. After self-harm, 335 (11·7%) of 2854 adults
  were referred to mental health services, 1692 (59·3%) were prescribed an antidepressant,
  and 336 (11·8%) were prescribed a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). Having a diagnosed
  previous mental illness was twice as prevalent in the self-harm cohort as in the
  comparison cohort (prevalence ratio 2·10 [95% CI 2·03–2·17]) and with a previous
  physical health condition prevalence was 20% higher in the self-harm cohort compared
  to the comparison cohort (1·20 [1·17–1·23]). Adults from the self-harm cohort (n=2454)
  died from unnatural causes an estimated 20 times more frequently than the comparison
  cohort (n=48 921) during the first year. A markedly elevated risk of suicide (hazard
  ratio 145·4 [95% CI 53·9–392·3]) was observed in the self-harm cohort.\n\n\nInterpretation:
  \n\nWithin primary care, we have identified a group of older adults at high risk
  from unnatural death, particularly within the first year of self-harm. We have highlighted
  a high frequency of prescription of TCAs, known to be potentially fatally toxic
  in overdose. We emphasise the need for early intervention, careful alternative prescribing,
  and increased support when older adults consult after an episode of self-harm and
  with other health conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
